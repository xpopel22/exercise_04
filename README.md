# Iterative and Recursive Algorithms

## The Change Problem
### Task 1
 * Convert some amount of money into the fewest number of coins.

 * Input: 
   * an amount of money `M` to be returned
 * Output: 
   * a minimum number of coins whose total value will be equal to `M`

 * Resources: 
   * coins in denominations of 50 (`pd`), 20(`dc`), 10(`ds`), 5(`p`), 2(`d`) and 1(`j`) CZK
 * Condition: 
   * `50 * pd + 20 * dc + 10 * ds + 5 * p + 2 * d + 1 * j = M`, where `pd`, `dc`, `ds`, `p`, `d` and `j` must have the smallest possible value

 * Write pseudocode according to previous detailed description of the algorithm. 

```
ReturnCoins(M)
1   Give the customer the integer result of dividing M by 50 in 50 CZK coins.
2   Let remainder be the remaining amount due the customer.
3   Give the customer the integer result of dividing remainder by 20 in 20 CZK coins.
4   Let remainder be the remaining amount due the customer.
5   Give the customer the integer result of dividing remainder by 10 in 10 CZK coins.
6   Let remainder be the remaining amount due the customer.
7   Give the customer the integer result of dividing remainder by 5 in 5 CZK coins.
8   Let remainder be the remaining amount due the customer.
9   Give the customer the integer result of dividing remainder by 2 in 2 CZK coins.
10  Give the customer remainder after division in 1 CZK coins.
```
 * Implement the algorithm in R as a function `ReturnCoins()`.

### Task 2
 * Convert some amount of money `M` into given denominations, using the smallest possible number of coins.

 * Input: 
   * an amount of money `M` to be returned
   * an array of `d` denominations `c = (c1, c2, ... , cd)` in descending order `(c1 > c2 > ··· > cd)`
 * Output:
   * integer values `i1, i2, ... , id` 
 * Condition: 
  * `c1 * i1 + c2 * i2 + ··· + cd * id = M`, where `i1 + i2 + ··· + id` is as small as possible

 * Write a pseudocode for the change problem for any currency. Hint: use array indexing. 
 * Implement the pseudocode in R as a separate function `UniversalReturnCoins()`. 
 * Find input values for which the algorithm will not work correctly, meaning the output will be incorrect.

## The Most Chocolate Path
### Task 3
 * In R, implement a recursive function `Chocolate()` according to the following pseudocode.

 * Input:
   * matrix with integer values (number of chocolate bars)
   * index of current row
   * index of current column

 * Output:
   * maximum number of chocolate bars, that can be collected

 * Solve the same problem iteratively.

```
Chocolate(M, r, c)
1   if r = number of rows in M
2     return M[r, c]
3   else
4     bars ← M[r, c]
5     down ← Chocolate(M, r + 1, c)
6     diagonal ← Chocolate(M, r + 1, c + 1)
7     return max(down, diagonal) + bars
```

## The Towers of Hanoi
### Task 4
In R, implement a function `HanoiTowers()` according to pseudocode. 

* Input: 
  * a number of discs
  * an index of starting peg
  * an index of a peg, where all disks will be to moved to
* Output: 
  * a sequence of steps to solve the towers of Hanoi problem

```
HanoiTowers(n, fromPeg, toPeg)
1   if n = 1
2     output "Move disc from peg fromPeg to peg toPeg"
3     return
4   unusedPeg ← 6 – fromPeg – toPeg
5   HanoiTowers(n – 1, fromPeg, unusedPeg)
6   output "Move disc from peg fromPeg to peg toPeg"
7   HanoiTowers(n – 1, emptyPeg, toPeg)
8   return
```
